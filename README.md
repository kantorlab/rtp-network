This repository contains the code and derived data objects used to produce the results reported in the paper above.

## Directories
### Used for paper

- `scripts/`: Contains various R scripts used for data processing, and analysis.

  - **Files:**
      - `data-breakdown.R`: Script for breaking down data into components (Last modified: 2024-09-17). ONLY FOR REFERENCE FROM HERE ON OUT/  
      **This file is now write-protected (permissions set to 644) and is only for reference. No further modifications should be made.**  

      - `summarize-databases-and-create-objects.R`: Script for summarizing databases and creating objects.

      - `database-overlap.R`: Consolidate second section of the results "Overlap Between the CTDB and the GDB"

      - `partner-naming-cascade.R`: Describes how many partners were named, contacted, reached, and so on, for all named partners and those appearing in both databases. 

      - `molecular-cluster-analysis.R`: Create molecular links within the clusters, and analyze the molecular networks. 

      - `regressions.rmd`: Fit the regression models in the last section of the results.

- `derived_data/`: Stores processed data objects (e.g., RDS files) generated from raw data. These are used in analyses to avoid reprocessing raw data each time.

- `manuscript-viz/`: Holds scripts and figures used in the manuscript preparation.

- `utils/`: Custom functions for computing cascades, counts by behavioral attributes, computing descriptives, etc. 

- `renv/`: Files for reproducibility, generated by `renv` package


### Background (no longer actively maintained)
